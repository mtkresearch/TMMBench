## How to Use the Benchmark

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Dependencies**

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements
   ```

2. **Download Benchmark Data**

   Download the evaluation data from the `MediaTek-Research/TMMBench` repository and set up as follows:
   - Create an `eval_data` folder in the project root if it doesn't exist
   - Place `Question_multiplechoice.tsv` in the `eval_data` folder

### Running the Benchmark

1. **Set Up OpenAI API Key**

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key"
   ```

2. **Execute the Evaluation Script**

   The `run_eval.py` script handles both response generation and judgment via GPT-4o:

   ```bash
   python run_eval.py
   ```

3. **Additional Options**

   You can customize the evaluation with these parameters:
   ```bash
   python run_eval.py --model_name MODEL_PATH --backend hf --log_dir logs/YOUR_MODEL/
   ```

   - `--model_name`: Path to your model (default: Llama-Breeze2-3B-Instruct)
   - `--backend`: Inference backend (options: hf, vllm, openai_api)
   - `--log_dir`: Directory to store results
